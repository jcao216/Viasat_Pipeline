# Viasat_Pipeline

So the rationale of making the pipeline in this fashion was to insure that the pipeline could run with as few external installations as possible (like Docker, etc.).  During the time spent researching out ways to make this pipeline, it seems that there were a lot of Java implementations.  As I did not know Java well enough to code out this pipeline, I spent time creating it in Python.  This also allowed me to utlize the hundreds of available Python packages.
